# Dimensionality of data

When working with *numeric* variables we imagine the data to live in a **Euclidean space** where each *variable* is mapped onto one *axis* spanning the space. Thus, the dimensionality of this space is determined by the number of variables in the data, with each variable adding a new *orthogonal* direction.

# How can we visualize high-dimensional data?

With up to three variables we can directly map the abstract data space onto our visualization, for example mapping two variables onto the x and y axis for a scatter plot display.

In more than three dimensions we need to find a way of mapping the high-dimensional space onto something that we can draw on our 2D screens.

- Dimension reduction
  + Linear projections (scatter plot matrix, PCA, LDA)
  + Non-linear dimension reduction (MDS, t-SNE)
- Parallel coordinate plots
- **Tour methods**

# Grand tour - Notation

We start from our data matrix $X_{n\times p}$, with $p$ variables and $n$ observations, and each view shows the data projected into a $d$-dimensional space (most commonly $d=2$ for a scatter plot display) defined by the projection matrix $A_{p\times d}$. The projected data is denoted $Y = X\cdot A$.

We need three components to generate a tour:

- selection method for target planes $A$
- interpolation method to smoothly rotate the view from the current plane towards the selected target
- display method to draw the projected data $Y$

# Implementation in R

All three components (with various options) have been implemented in `R` in the `tourr` package.

To get started you can have a look at the [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tourr/vignettes/tourr.html).

The main function is called `animate`, by default it will show a *grand tour* with 2D projections in a scatter plot display.

```{r, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(tourr)
f <- flea[, 1:6]
animate(f)
```

        )
```

# Finding targets

In the *grand tour* the target planes are selected randomly from all possible projections. This works well for getting an overview of data as long as $p$ is not too large. Other methods:

- `guided_tour` selects targets that optimize a *projection pursuit index*: we define a measure that indicates the *interestingness* of each projection and only select planes with increasing interestingness along the tour path
- `little_tour` selects axis-parallel projections as targets
- `local_tour` explores a small neighborhood around a selected projection
- `planned_tour` interpolates between a supplied set of target planes

# Summary

- Tour methods can visualize high-dimensional data and reveal multivariate structure and outliers, and help us understand grouping
- The `tourr` package includes different methods for basis selection, an algorithm for geodesic interpolation and many display functions
- Since we rely on linear projections, tour displays are straightforward to interpret
- Tours can be used as a complementary method together with non-linear dimension reduction
- These methods can benefit from interactive interfaces, some recent efforts are available in `R` packages: `liminal`, `spinifex`
